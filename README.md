Horiseon-Webpage-Project

This project is an on the job ticket. I was given some starter code, and then tasked with improving (refractoring)
the code. The main objective of the project is to fix all of the issues with the code, to make it more functional, and also
to make it more organized and to make sure it follows all the correct structures.

This project was made as practice for setting up a functional website, learning how to use GitHub and much more. I also 
learned a lot about media queries, and resizing, and much more.

Throughout building this, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with. Most of these occured when moving my code 
from VSCode to Github. Therefore there are a lot of commits in this repo, many of which may have been slightly unnecessary.

This whole project was created using just HTML and CSS.

In this project, I made sure that all the links were working, and I made many changes to the resizing. This allows
the elements to keep all of the text in the correct spaces and not allow it to overflow. Additionally, it allows the proper elements to be moved to
new parts of the page to keep it looking professional. Also, media queries were used to make blank space fill up upon resizing, such as when the side bar gets 
moved below the rest of the elements.

The project is quite simple. There are three links, and they each take the reader to the appropriate section of the the page, 
upon being clicked.

CREDITS: I got the starter code for this project off of Github. The username of the peron that created the repository is

These are the index.html and style.css files.
